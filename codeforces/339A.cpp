// Xenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school. She is now learning the addition operation.

// The teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers. Pupils should calculate the sum. To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2 and 3. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+3.

// You've got the sum that was written on the board. Rearrange the summans and print the sum in such a way that Xenia can calculate the sum.

// Input
// The first line contains a non-empty string s â€” the sum Xenia needs to count. String s contains no spaces. It only contains digits and characters "+". Besides, string s is a correct sum of numbers 1, 2 and 3. String s is at most 100 characters long.

// Output
// Print the new sum that Xenia can count.
